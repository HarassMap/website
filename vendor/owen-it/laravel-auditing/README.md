Laravel Auditing allows you to record changes to an Eloquent model's set of data by simply adding its trait to your model. Laravel Auditing also provides a simple interface for retreiving an audit trail for a piece of data and allows for a great deal of customization in how that data is provided.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the package can be found on the [Laravel Auditing website](http://laravel-auditing.herokuapp.com/).
